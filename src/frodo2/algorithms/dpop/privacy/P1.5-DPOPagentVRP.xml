				- frodo2.solutionSpaces.crypto.ElGamalScheme, which takes the following parameters:
					- modulus: must be a safe prime whose number of bits is greater than n * (D - n), 
						where n is the number of variables in the DCOP, and D is the sum of all domain sizes
					- generator: must be such that the powers of the generator cover all the numbers in [1, modulus - 1]
						(Use ElGamalScheme.main() to create the modulus and the generator)
					- infinity: the algorithm will ignore solutions whose cost is >= this value. The complexity (both in memory and runtime)
						is linear in this parameter, so you want to set it to a tight upper bound on the cost of the optimal solution (if any). 
						For pure satisfaction problems, you should choose infinity = 1.
