<!-- Overall definition of the agent
	- measureTime: whether the simulated time metric should be enabled instead of just measuring wall clock time
	- measureMsgs: whether to measure the number of messages and the total amount of information sent (WARNING! This is computationally expensive)
 -->
<agentDescription className = "frodo2.algorithms.SingleQueueAgent" measureTime = "true" measureMsgs = "false" >
	
	<!-- The MailMan used when measuring time
		 - mailmanClass: the class of the mailman to be used
	-->
	<mailman mailmanClass = "frodo2.communication.mailer.CentralMailer"/>
	
	<!-- The XCSP parser
		- parserClass: the class of the parser/subsolver to be used. Currently supported:
			- frodo2.algorithms.XCSPparser: the default parser that does not consider local subproblems
			- frodo2.solutionSpaces.JaCoP.JaCoPxcspParser: a parser based on JaCoP that can be used for DCOPs with complex local subproblems
		- displayGraph: if true, displays the constraint graph in DOT format (default = false)
		- domClass: the class to be used for variable values; the supported values are: 
			- frodo2.solutionSpaces.AddableInteger 	(default) for integer-valued variables
		- utilClass: the class to be used for utility values; the supported values are: 
			- frodo2.solutionSpaces.AddableInteger 	(default) for integer utilities
		- DOTrenderer: the class to be used to display the constraint graph. Supported values:
			- empty string: displays the constraint graph in DOT format in the console; 
			- frodo2.gui.DOTrenderer: renders the constraint graph in a new window. Assumes that Graphviz' "dot" command is on the shell path.

	<!-- A set of modules, each being parameterized by the following attributes: 
		- className: the name of the class implementing the module
		- reportStats (only for StatsReporter modules): whether statistics should be reported to the central controller, if any (default = false)
		- messages (optional): a list of "message" elements, each parameterized by the following attributes: 
			- name: the name of the public static String field in the module that identifies the message
			- value: the type to be used for that message
			- ownerClass (optional): if present, specifies the name of a class, and the attribute "value" is then interpreted as a public static String field of that class
